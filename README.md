# Atm_sim_pro
 Java ATM Interface: A sophisticated simulation employing Swing/AWT for GUI and JDBC for MySQL integration. It encapsulates core ATM functionalities like user authentication, financial transactions, withdrawals, deposits, fast cash options, mini-statements, balance inquiries, and PIN management, all presented on an interactive ATM-themed interface.

# Java ATM Interface Project

## Overview
This Java project simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) interface, combining Swing and AWT for the graphical user interface, and JDBC for MySQL database connectivity. It replicates key functionalities of an ATM, offering a comprehensive and interactive desktop application experience.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with card number and PIN.
- **Transactions**: View, withdraw, deposit, and manage account transactions.
- **Fast Cash & Mini Statement**: Quick cash withdrawals and transaction history overview.
- **Balance Inquiry & PIN Change**: Check account balance and update PIN for enhanced security.

## Technical Stack
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI**: Swing and AWT
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Connectivity**: JDBC

The interface is crafted around an ATM image, with interactive buttons overlaid to mimic a physical ATM's operations.

## Setup and Run
